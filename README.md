# Polynomial_interpolator
<b>     A program that returns the polynomial of a function, along with its respective graph, when given its data sets, using the Newton method of polynomial interpolation.</b>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
        Challenge.       
<h1>Example</h1>
        Given a set of x and y coordinates, let's say [(-2, -9), (-1, -15), (0, -5), (1, -3), (2, 39)], we use polynomial interpolation to find the polynom in wich the cordinates are represented, wich, in that case, would be: 3x⁴ + 2x³ − 7x² + 4x -5

<h1>How to use</h1>
        Enter the number of elements that will go in both sets (set of x, set of f(x)), then enter the values of each one. Following, the polynomial will be given, along with a graphical representation in x and y coordinates.
